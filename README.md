# WhatsApp-Chat-Analyzer
> Whatsapp claims that nearly 55 billion messages are sent each day. The average user spends 195 minutes per week on Whatsapp, and is a member of plenty of groups. With this treasure house of data right under our very noses, it is but imperative that we embark on a mission to gain insights on the messages our phones are forced to bear witness to. This project aims to serve as a step-by-step guide to create a whatsapp conversation analyzer

## Prerequisites
> Pandas

> Seaborn

> Matplotlib

> Jupyter (Optional but useful since you can see intermediate outputs easily while following the steps in this tutorial) OR if you are lazy like me and donâ€™t feel like installing any of these packages, just head over to Google Colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com) which is a free Jupyter notebook environment that comes with everything pre-installed, and get started in a jiffy!
